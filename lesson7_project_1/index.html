    <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
  
    <p>What was once a impossible idea, will soon be the new normal for transportation around the world. </p>
  
    <p>Believe it or not self driving cars are here and will be the future for automobiles whether we like it or not. Every company seems to be chasing googles sibling company, Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo. They have other company's such as General Motors beat by at least a year to introduce driver less cars to the public. The cars they use are Chrysler Pacifica minivans, which are equip with tons of sensors that can see hundreds of yards in 360 degrees. No company is near this, let alone preparing to carry passengers in more than one city by the end of this year.</p>
  
    <p>The next closest contender seems to be GM who plans to have the Chevrolet Bolt ready to go by late 2019.The investor, SoftBank Vision Fund. The huge Japanese tech investor has been backing the plan and has dumped nearly 2.25 billion dollars into GM's autonomous driving research and production. Most other car companys that are also trying to produce self driving vehicles are going at a much more cautions rate, predicting a completion date of 2020 or even later. The road ahead wont be easy for these companies. But it is peddle to the metal and its a race to see who will have the first fully functioning self driving car.</p>
  
    <p>Leading Self Driving Car Producers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Waymo (Google)</li>
      <li>GM</li>
      <li>Tesla</li>
      <li>Renault</li>
      <li>Audi</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Though the idea of self driving vehicles is awesome and everyone wants to be a part of it. These new pieces of technology bring great risk to people around the world and can be seen as very dangerous. One of the biggest risks with self driving cars is road accidents. Roads are rarely predictable and something can happen at anytime and who's to say the driver-less car is able to cope with these sudden changes? Along with who is to blame when a accident happens? Since you cant blame someone if there isn't anyone driving it. Another risk is vehicle hacking and malfunctions. What if someone is a good hacker, they could intentionally kill someone that was in a self driving vehicle if they took over the computer driving it. Lastly we as people increase our exposure to radiation when in a self driving vehicle because of all the GPS technology around the car.</p>
  
    <p>With all this technology evolving for self driving cars. Many should begin to worry about there job security. Eventually self driving vehicles will take over the truck industry and many more. Bus driving positions will be out the window and will be all automated. While companies like amazon are getting bigger and bigger, the need for a way to transport these goods is also getting bigger. About a year ago the first truck traveled over 120 miles carrying 45,000 cans of Budweiser beer with no one driving it. Though it may be over a decade until self driving trucks completely control the trucking industry. Many should still be worried now simply because there is no denying that it's coming.</p>
